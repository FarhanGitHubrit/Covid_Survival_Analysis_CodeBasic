# Covid_Survival_Analysis_CodeBasic
Data-driven analysis to help a legacy newspaper, Bharat Herald, transition from print to digital in a post-COVID era. This project includes SQL-based data cleaning, business insights, and strategic recommendations to boost digital engagement, regain advertiser trust, and optimize revenue models.


Bharat Herald: Digital Transformation Strategy
📰 Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive data-driven analysis to guide Bharat Herald, a legacy newspaper organization in India, through an existential crisis accelerated by the post-COVID digital shift. Facing a significant decline in print circulation and advertiser confidence, the company needs a clear roadmap for digital transformation to ensure its survival.

The analysis quantifies the decline in print operations and ad revenue between 2019 and 2024, identifies recovery potential in key markets, and proposes a phased strategy for a digital relaunch.

🎯 Key Objectives
Quantify Operational & Financial Decline: Analyze print circulation, sales, waste, and ad revenue trends from 2019–2024 to understand the severity of the crisis.

Identify High-Potential Markets: Determine which cities show the highest potential for a digital transition based on digital readiness metrics (smartphone, internet, and literacy rates) and existing performance.

Prioritize Digital Relaunch: Recommend a phased roadmap, specifically prioritizing the first three cities for Phase 1 of the digital relaunch.

Propose Recovery Strategies: Offer recommendations on regaining advertiser trust, improving digital engagement (e.g., content formats, delivery models), and exploring new revenue models (e.g., subscriptions, bundling).

🛠️ Data Sources & Tools

❓ Analysis Questions Addressed
The project answers critical questions posed by the Executive Director (Tony Sharma) and the assigned Data Analyst (Peter Pandey), which fall into two main categories:

Primary Analysis (Quantifying the Problem)
Print Circulation Trends: What is the year-over-year trend in copies printed, sold, and net circulation across all cities?

Top Performing Cities: Which cities contribute the highest to net circulation and copies sold, and are they still profitable?

Print Waste Analysis: Which cities have the largest and most persistent gap between copies printed and net circulation?

Ad Revenue Trends: How has ad revenue evolved across different ad categories, and which have declined or remained strong?

Ad Revenue vs. Circulation ROI: Which cities show the highest ad revenue per net circulated copy?

Digital Readiness vs. Performance: Which cities have high digital readiness but low digital pilot engagement?

Digital Relaunch Prioritization: Based on digital readiness, pilot engagement, and print decline, which 3 cities should be prioritized for Phase 1 of the digital relaunch?

Secondary Analysis (Formulating the Solution)
Phased Digital Transition: What should the phased digital transition strategy look like based on readiness and engagement data?

Advertiser Trust: How can Bharat Herald regain advertiser trust in key cities or categories where confidence has dropped significantly?

Content and Delivery Changes: What changes to content format or delivery (e.g., WhatsApp bulletins, mobile-optimized e-papers) might boost digital engagement?

New Revenue Models: What role can subscription bundling, loyalty programs, or pay-per-article models play in revenue recovery?

🚀 Key Recommendations & Findings
This section will be populated with a concise summary of your most important findings once the analysis is complete.

Priority Cities for Digital Relaunch (Phase 1): [City A, City B, City C]

Circulation Insight: Overall print circulation dropped from over 1.2 million to under 560,000 between 2019 and 2024.

Strategic Recommendation: Implement a mobile-first content strategy focusing on [<e.g., WhatsApp Delivery/Local Journalism>].
